# Instructions to Run the Application

This document provides instructions on how to run the "Modern BVBS Korb Generator" application locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: This application uses a Node.js package to serve the files. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**

2. **Navigate to the root directory of the project.** This is the directory where the `index.html` and `package.json` files are located.

3. **Install the `serve` package.** The `serve` package is a simple HTTP server that can serve static files. You can install it globally on your system by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use `npx`, which allows you to run Node.js packages without installing them globally. If you prefer this method, you can skip this step.

4. **Start the application.** You can start the application in one of two ways:

   - If you installed `serve` globally, you can use the `npm start` command, which is defined in the `package.json` file:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   - If you prefer to use `npx`, you can run the following command:

     ```bash
     npx serve .
     ```

5. **Access the application in your browser.** Once the server is running, it will provide you with a local URL. The default URL is usually:

   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

   Open this URL in your web browser to view and use the application.

## Stopping the Application

To stop the application, go back to your terminal or command prompt and press `Ctrl + C`.
